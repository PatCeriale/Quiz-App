# Quiz-App

**Overview:**

> This is a simple quiz game with the content being the creator's Super Opinionated Beer Trivia. The player must click the start button to begin the game and use the buttons to guess the correct answer. If correct, the player's score is increased. If incorrect, the player is penalized by losing time from the countdown clock. Once the game is complete, either by answering all the questions or the time running out, the player's score is calculated. The user will be asked to enter their name, and it will be placed on the score board along with their score.

**Deployment**

> Launch url in web browser and click the "Start Quiz" button to start the quiz. Once time is up, input your name and see how you did compared to your friends!

**Technologies:**

> This Quiz App was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The questions and answers were organized in an object array and are called upon with the click event of the "start quiz" button. The answers for the corresponding question are buttons displayed in the "Game Board" element of the HTML file, that when clicked, check to see if the answer the user selected equals the correct answer. If correct, the score is increased, however if the score is incorrect, the time is reduced by 5 seconds. The user's name and score are saved to the local storage and will be able to be called upon to compare multiple attempts at the quiz.

**Future Development:**

> In the future, it would be exciting to add pictures to each question, making the game more visually interactive for the player.
